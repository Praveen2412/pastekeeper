# PasteKeeper Mobile App - Complete Documentation (Part 4)

## Troubleshooting and Edge Cases

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Clipboard Access Restrictions**:
   - **Issue**: Some mobile apps restrict clipboard access or don't properly update the system clipboard
   - **Solution**: Implement alternative detection methods and fallbacks
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use accessibility services (with user permission) to detect copy operations
     - Provide manual paste option for content that can't be automatically detected
     - Implement OCR for capturing text from screenshots when clipboard access fails

2. **Background Process Limitations**:
   - **Issue**: Mobile operating systems restrict background processes, limiting clipboard monitoring
   - **Solution**: Use a combination of foreground service, scheduled checks, and system events
   - **Implementation**:
     - Create a lightweight foreground service for Android with notification
     - Use app refresh and background fetch on iOS
     - Implement widget-based monitoring as an alternative
     - Provide manual refresh option when automatic monitoring fails

3. **Storage Limitations**:
